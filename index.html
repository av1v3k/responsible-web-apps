						The title for this page came from a slip of my tongue.
						I actually had wanted to say "responsive and accessible" web applications,
						but somehow "responsible" slipped out.
					</p>
					<p>
						Regardless of how I came up with the term, I do consider it to be fitting
						because I think it irresponsible to develop a web application
						without considering either responsiveness or accessibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is extremely difficult and expensive to add responsiveness and accessibility after the fact.
						For this reason, we need to take them into account
						from the very beginning.
					</p>
					<p>
						Luckily, with modern HTML and CSS, we can create responsive and
						accessible web apps with relative ease. In my years of doing software development,
						I have learned some HTML and CSS tips and tricks, and I want to present these in
						this post. This list is not exhaustive, but these are tried and true patterns that
						I frequently use in different projects.

					<p>Do we really need responsive web design for our web application? We will only use our web application on desktop computers!</p>

					<p>
						I've heard this argument many times, but in the long term, it has never turned out to be true.
						For this reason, I've created Joy's two laws of web development:

					<p>When it comes to the technical implementation of responsive design, there are two main categories of components that we need to develop:</p>
					<p><strong>Responsive Layout Containers & Squishy Components</strong></p>
					<p>We want to cover these two aspects in the next sections</p>
				</section>
				<section class="subsubsection">
					<h3 id="Responsive-Layout-Containers">Responsive Layout Containers<a href="#Responsive-Layout-Containers" aria-label="Link to Responsive Layout Containers"></a></h3>
					<p>
						We firstly need to make sure that we put a lot of thought into designing layout containers which adjust themselves based on the size of our viewport.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						In the following demo, we can see how we can define a layout conceptually using different grid areas.

					</p>
					<figure>
						<div class="horizontal-scroll responsive-example" aria-hidden="true">
							<span class="caption">Mobile Devices</span>
							<article class="layout-example" data-observe-resizes>
								<header>
									Header
								</header>
								<aside>
									Sidebar
								</aside>
								<div class="main">
									Main Content
								</div>
								<aside>
									Second Sidebar
								</aside>
								<footer>
									Footer
								</footer>
							</article>
							<span class="caption">Tablet and up</span>
							<article class="layout-example tabletUp">
								<header>
									Header
								</header>
								<aside class="squishy-text">

								<aside class="squishy-text">
									Second Sidebar

								<footer>
									Footer
								</footer>
							</article>

						</div>
						<figcaption>
							A UI example showing how content will be stacked vertically on smaller devices,
							but on larger viewports we can then use the increased horizontal space to display
							certain content areas next to each other.
							<p class="visually-hidden">
								The demo shows five content areas: Header, Sidebar, Main Content, Second Sidebar, and Footer.
								On a mobile device, these areas are shown vertically stacked.
								On larger viewports, the example layout now has three rows and three columns.
								The Header area spans the full width of the top of the viewport in the first row.
								In the middle row, the Sidebar, Main Content, and Second Sidebar areas are positioned
								next to each other in a three column layout, with the Main Content area expanding
								to take up as much space as it can. The Footer area then spans the full width of
								the viewport in the bottom row of the layout.
							</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>How can we implement this? To do this, I like to use the following technique.</p>

					<h4 id="CSS-Grid-with-Breakpoints">Explicit CSS Grid Layout with Breakpoints<a href="#CSS-Grid-with-Breakpoints" aria-label="Link to Explicit CSS Grid Layout with Breakpoints"></a></h4>

					<p>
						Using CSS Grid, I like to use the following technique to declaratively define a default CSS grid for our content.
						This is then the CSS which is used for smaller devices.
					</p>

					<h5>CSS for Mobile Devices</h5>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code used to program the mobile layout Responsive Layout example"><code>.layout {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-areas:
		"header"
		"sidebar"
		"main"
		"sidebar-right"
		"footer";
	grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr auto auto;
}
.layout > header {
	grid-area: header;
}
.layout > aside:nth-of-type(1) {
	grid-area: header;
}
.layout > main {
	grid-area: main;
}
.layout > aside:nth-of-type(2) {
	grid-area: header;
}
.layout > footer {
	grid-area: footer;
}
</code></pre>

					<p>
						Note that this markup explicitly references the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main">
						main</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">
						header</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer">
						footer</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside">
						aside</a> semantic HTML elements in the CSS code.
						This was intentional here, because it forces us to then use the semantic HTML elements and add important landmarks to our web application which improves its accessibility.
						With the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator">child combinator</a> operator (<tt>></tt>) we ensure that this element targeted is the direct child of the parent with my layout class (which we would probably add directly to our HTML body).
					</p>

					<h5 id="On-Tablets-or-larger-devices">CSS for tablets or larger devices</h5>

					<p>
						Since we have already defined the <tt>grid-areas</tt> for our HTML elements, we can now declaratively change the layout using a relatively short CSS snippet within a media query:
					</p>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code used to program the Responsive Layout example for larger devices"><code>@media (min-width: var(--tablet-portrait-up)) {
	.layout {
		grid-template-areas:
			"header header header"
			"sidebar main sidebar-right"
			"footer footer footer";
		grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
		grid-template-columns: 20% 1fr 20%;
	}
}
</code></pre>

						<p>
							Note that when you are defining your breakpoints for your application,
							you should consider the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862/">correct way to do CSS breakpoints</a>.

					<section class="subsubsection">
						<h3 id="Squishy-Components">Squishy Components<a href="#Squishy-Components" aria-label="Link to Squishy Components"></a></h3>

						<p>
							After we have a responsive layout, the next step is to make sure that all of our components are "squishy".
							This means that when we place a component into a designated area of a layout,
							it should never push itself outside of its designated area.
							Instead it should "squish" down to fit inside of the available space.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is especially important because our layout container assumes that all of its
							content is going to fit, and if this assumption is not true, this could cause the
							whole layout to be wider than the viewport and make it necessary for the user to scroll
							horizontally.

<pre class="language-css"><code>.container {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
}
</code></pre>

						<p>We can use the <tt>display: flex;</tt> rule together with <tt>flex-wrap: wrap;</tt> </p>
						<p>
							When there is not enough space for the items to be placed horizontally,
							they will begin to wrap and be shown stacked vertically instead.

						<p>
							When we talk about creating an application which is responsive, this doesn't mean that we need to optimize
							all of our layouts for small device screens. In certain contexts, we will have larger data representations
							(e.g. tables or code examples), which we also want to be available for smaller devices even if they are not
							optimized for that layout.
						</p>
						<p>
							For this, I like to use a wrapper around tables and code examples which make them able to be scrolled horizontally
							when there is not enough space for them in the current layout.
						</p>

					<div class="horizontal-scroll responsive-example">
						<article class="example-table">

					<p>
						The following example is a CSS meme now.
						By default, long words in an HTML document will not be hyphenated by default,
						so they will break out of their containing box instead of squishing to fit inside of it.
						This is especially important when we are dealing with a language which has a lot of long words
						(<em>*cough* German *cough*</em>).
					</p>
					<p>
						The previous CSS snippet is one I have successfully used to make my text squishy in different contexts.

						<p>
							We now come to accessibility.
							Here I feel that I can only scratch the surface of the different things that we should consider.
							I also am learning new things all the time, so I'm sure that this list is not exhaustive.
							But I do think it is a good starting off point.

					<section>
						<h3 id="Headings">Headings<a href="#Headings" aria-label="Link to Headings"></a></h3>
						<p>Don’t skip heading levels.</p>
						<p>
							In your HTML Document, you need to ensure that your document hierarchy is complete and doesn't skip levels.
							Otherwise it will seem to a screenreader user that content is missing.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a mistake that many developers make,
							because we pay attention to how the heading appears visually without making sure that an <tt>h2</tt> is always
							directly followed by a <tt>h3</tt>.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="Landmarks">Landmarks<a href="#Landmarks" aria-label="Link to Landmarks"></a></h3>
						<p>
							We should make sure that we use elements like
							<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main">main</a> and
							<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">header</a>
							because then we get HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Landmark_roles">landmarks</a>
							out of the box.
							This makes the page much easier to navigate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note that the <tt>main</tt> element is not well supported for IE11, so if you have to
							support older browsers, you should also consider using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Main_role#Skip_navigation">skip links</a>.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="nav-element">nav Element<a href="#nav-element" aria-label="Link to nav Element"></a></h3>
						<p>
							When you are providing links for a user to navigate within your page (e.g. a navbar or a table of contents),
							you should wrap them in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">nav</a>.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="label-element">label Element<a href="#label-element" aria-label="Link to label Element"></a></h3>
						<p><em>Always</em> add a label to add extra context for input elements</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;label&gt;
	First Name
	&lt;input type="text" value="name" placeholder="Jane Smith" /&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

						<p>
							Here we either wrap the input field directly in the label,
							or we can use the <tt>for</tt> attribute and link it to a specific input field.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here it is important to not use the <tt>placeholder</tt> attribute to label the input field.
							The placeholder attribute should be used to show an example of how the data we expect should appear.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="list-elements">List Elements<a href="#list-elements" aria-label="Link to List Elements"></a></h3>
						<p>
							Using lists (an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul">unordered list</a>,
							an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol">ordered list</a>, or a
							<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">description list</a>) for things in a UI will also add extra context for screenreaders.
							Specifically, it will tell a screenreader how many elements are contained in the following list.
						</p>
						<p>
							In practice, description lists can be difficult to style because it is not allowed to add an extra <tt>div</tt> as a wrapper around the <tt>dt</tt> and <tt>dd</tt> elements.
							For this reason, I've also done <a href="https://joyheron.com/a11y-playground/represent-labelled-information.html" target="_blank">some experiments about how to best group information in the UI</a>.
							Here there isn't a single correct solution.
							You will have to find out what works best for your UI.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="accordions">Accordions<a href="#aria-expanded-for-developing-Accordions" aria-label="Accordions"></a></h3>

						<p>
							If we need an accordion, or an element which shows/hides a content area,
							we can use the HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">details</a> element.
						</p>

<pre class="language-html" aria-label="Code example using a details element"><code>&lt;details&gt;
	&lt;summary&gt;Toggle Button&lt;/summary&gt;
	Content which will be
&lt;/details&gt;
</code></pre>

						<p>
							We can also implement this using JavaScript using a <tt>button</tt> and the
							<tt>aria-expanded</tt> attribute.
							The <tt>aria-expanded</tt> attribute adds context information to the <em>button</em> which will tell the screenreader
							if the area that the button is toggling is currently collapsed or expanded.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have seen incorrect implementations of this where the developer thought that the attribute was intended to be added to
							the content block which is expanded or collapsed, but this is not the case and that implementation would be confusing to any screenreader user.
							If we do spend the effort to set aria roles in our application (which we should),
							we need to test our application and make sure they are used correctly!
							No aria usage is better than incorrect aria usage.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have implemented this behavior many times, and when I do, I prefer to use a custom element and activate
							the toggle with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>.
							This means that my toggle button is hidden by default before JavaScript is activated, and the content area that is to be collapsed/expanded
							will only be hidden once JavaScript is activated.
						</p>
						<p>
							The contract for the <tt>toggle-button</tt> component that I usually end up writing therefore usually looks something like this:
						</p>

<pre class="language-html" aria-label="HTML code showing the contract for the toggle-button component"><code>&lt;button is="toggle-button" data-target="#section2"
		aria-expanded="false" hidden&gt;Toggle Section 2&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

						<p><em>aria-expanded</em> is an attribute of the BUTTON which tells a screen reader if the content area that is being expanded/collapsed is currently visible or not.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							And my <tt>toggle-button</tt> implementation usually looks a lot like the following
							(I really need to standardize this and publish a custom element one of these days...):
						</p>

<pre class="language-js"><code>class ToggleButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
	connectedCallback () {
		this.removeAttribute("hidden");
		if (this.getAttribute("aria-expanded") !== "true") {
			this.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "false");
			this.target.classList.add("hide");
		}
		this.addEventListener("click", this.toggle.bind(this));

						<h3 id="aria-label-and-aria-labelledby">aria-label and aria-labelledby<a href="#aria-label-and-aria-labelledby" aria-label="Link to aria-label and aria-labelledby"></a></h3>
						<p>
							Sometimes we have visual elements which add information to the UI,
							but are missing in the UI. For these cases, we can use an <tt>aria-label</tt> with a
							textual description of what the visual element is showing. If there is already a UI
							element available, we can also use <tt>aria-labelledby</tt> and reference the HTML id of
							the existing element.
							The HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title">title</a>
							element is not well supported in screenreaders, so it should not be used to do this.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here it really helps to test your UI in a screenreader so that you can figure out where
							extra labels would be helpful <span aria-label="winking emoji">😉</span>.
						</p>

						<h3 id="Hiding-content-visually">Hiding content visually (but not from screenreaders)<a href="#Hiding-content-visually" aria-label="Link to hiding content visually"></a></h3>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code snippet to hide HTML visually"><code>.visually-hidden {
	clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
	clip-path: inset(50%);
	height: 1px;
	overflow: hidden;
	position: absolute;
	white-space: nowrap;
	width: 1px;
}
</code></pre>

						<p>
							Sometimes we want to hide elements from our UI.
							If we use a CSS rule like <tt>display: none;</tt>,
							this not only hides the element visually,
							but also hides it from screenreaders.
							We can use the previous CSS snippet (or one like it),
							to hide the content visually without removing it from
							the accessibility tree.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="Setting-focus-correctly">Setting focus correctly<a href="#Setting-focus-correctly" aria-label="Link to setting focus correctly"></a></h3>
						<p>
							As long as you are writing only HTML and CSS,
							there isn't any good reason why you would want to mess with the <tt>focus</tt> within your webpage,
							because the semantics and structure of HTML is very well designed.
							However, when we begin to modify the HTML of our application with client-side JavaScript,
							we need to think about the focus and if we need to update it as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							For instance, if we are adding content to our DOM with JavaScript,
							as I did with this
							<a href="https://joyheron.com/a11y-playground/show-more-pagination.html" target="_blank">“Show More” Pagination Example</a>,
							we should consider whether we should move the focus to the new content after it has loaded.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this case, we need to <strong>make absolute sure</strong> that you
							<strong>test the application with a screenreader and keyboard</strong>
							to ensure that the focus is set correctly.
							There is little that can break your UI more than incorrectly setting the focus.
